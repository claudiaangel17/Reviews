# ðŸ“Œ Pinning Important Threads & Responses

Learn how to elevate essential information and improve team collaboration using GitHub Discussions' pinning features.

## Welcome

Effective communication in open-source and team-driven projects often depends on how well key information is surfaced. GitHub Discussions provides a space for structured conversationsâ€”but without the ability to highlight critical threads or responses, important decisions and solutions can get buried.

This skill will walk you through how to create a discussion, pin full threads, and highlight individual responses. You'll learn how pinning supports better project organization, knowledge retention, and team transparencyâ€”especially in fast-moving repositories. By the end, youâ€™ll know when and how to use pinning to make your Discussions more valuable for everyone.

## Who is this for:

- New and experienced contributors using GitHub Discussions  
- Community managers, team leads, and non-technical collaborators  
- Anyone looking to streamline communication in open-source or internal projects

## What you'll learn:

- How to create a new GitHub Discussion  
- How to pin entire threads for visibility  
- How to mark specific replies as answers (and why that matters)  
- Best practices for keeping pinned content clean and useful
